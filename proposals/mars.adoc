== Mars Project Proposal


*Name of the project*: Mars

*Requested project maturity level*: Incubation

*Project description*

Mars is a tensor-based unified framework for large-scale data computation
which scales Numpy, pandas, Scikit-learn and Python functions.

Mars is designed to be production-grade, utilizing parallel and distributed technology to
accelerate Python data science technique stack. NVIDIA GPU can be leveraged as well for acceleration purpose.

Mars is fairly simple to integrate with large amount of popular Python machine learning and
deep learning libraries, e.g. XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Statsmodels and joblib.

*Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission:*

Mars tensor as well as DataFrame are dedicated to accelerate numpy and pandas which is crucial for data preprocessing,
Mars learn is designed to bring scikit-learn to a cluster to accelerate machine learning workloads.
Besides, Mars is born to be more friendly to integrate with existing machine learning and deep learning libraries.
